Apple File System
=================

The Apple File System (APFS) is a copy-on-write filesystem apparently intended
to replace HFS+ on all Apple devices in the near future. This modules provides
a degree of experimental read-only support on Linux.

Known limitations
=================

This module is the result of reverse engineering. As it is read-only there
should be no risk of data corruption, but do not expect everything to be read
correctly. Testing in general has been limited so far, so you may experience
crashes. Please report any issues that you find.

Apple has realeased other versions of the filesystem to the public before the
current one. I would not expect them to be compatible with this module at all,
but I am open to fixing that if requested.

Many features are not yet supported:

 o Encryption.
 o Compression, though the compressed contents of a file can be read from the
   'com.apple.decmpfs' and 'com.apple.ResourceFork' xattrs as long as they are
   under 64k.
 o Restoring to a snapshot.
 o Access control lists. This is not a priority.

Mount options
=============

When mounting an APFS filesystem, the following options are accepted:

  vol=n
	Volume number to mount. The default is volume 0.

  uid=n, gid=n
	Override on-disk inode ownership data with given uid/gid.

The APFS module was written by Ernesto A. Fern√°ndez, based on reverse
engineering done by others [1][2]. Some parts of the code imitate the
ext2 module, and to a lesser degree xfs, udf, gfs2 and hfsplus.
